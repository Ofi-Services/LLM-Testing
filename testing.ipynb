    "        - \"Where do most claims happen?\" → likely refers to **branch**.\n",

    "    ### Query Guidelines  \n",
    "    1. Convert any time differences (e.g., between `insurance_start` and `insurance_creation`) from `INTERVAL` to a numeric type, such as seconds or minutes, for accurate calculations.\n",
    "    2. Use functions like `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)` to convert `INTERVAL` types into numeric values (e.g., seconds) that can be averaged.\n",
    "    3. **Use Table Aliases**: \"cases\" → c, \"activity\" → a.\n",
    "    4. **Always Reference Columns with Aliases**: c.\"id\", a.\"case\".\n",
    "    5. **Handle Aggregations**: Include non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY.\n",
    "    6. **Date & Time Calculations**: Use EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...) for durations.\n",
    "    7. **Filtering Conditions**: Use TRUE/FALSE for boolean values.\n",
    "    8. **Use Explicit Joins**: Avoid implicit joins.\n",
    "    9. **Optimize for Performance**: Use indexes, avoid unnecessary calculations, and limit results when needed.\n",
    "    10. **Restrict Queries to Existing Tables**: Only use \"cases\", \"activity\", and \"variants\" tables.\n",
    "    11. **Use JOINS only when necessary**: Avoid unnecessary joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Special Handling for Variant Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Most Frequent Path (Reference Variant)**:\n",
    "    - To get the most common path, query the `variants` table ordered by `number_cases` and pick the top 1:\n",
    "        SELECT * FROM variants ORDER BY number_cases DESC LIMIT 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Deviations from Reference Path**:\n",
    "    - Get all other variants whose `activities` string differs from the reference variant.\n",
    "    - You can compare variants by filtering where activities != <reference_activities>.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Find Point of Deviation**:\n",
    "    - If needed, split the `activities` string into individual steps using SPLIT(activities, ' → ') or REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_ARRAY.\n",
    "    - Compare each index to find where the variant differs from the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Impact on Duration**:\n",
    "    - Compare avg_time values from the reference path to each deviating variant’s avg_time.\n",
    "    - Calculate the difference in duration to assess performance impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Reminder\n",
    "    - Do not guess or hardcode values like activity names unless explicitly mentioned.\n",
    "    - When asked about the most common path, select the variant with the highest number_cases.\n",
    "    - For deviations, always compare against that top variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Output Format  \n",
    "    - Return only the SQL query, with no extra formatting.  \n",
    "    - Do **NOT** include language tags like `sql`, `vbnet`, or any other markers.  \n",

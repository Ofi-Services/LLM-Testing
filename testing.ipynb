    "    2. Use functions like `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)` to convert `INTERVAL` types into numeric values (e.g., seconds) that can be averaged.\n",

    "    4. **Always Reference Columns with Aliases**: c.\"id\", a.\"case\".\n",
    "    5. **Handle Aggregations**: Include non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY.\n",
    "    6. **Date & Time Calculations**: Use EXTRACT(DAY FROM ...) for durations.\n",
    "    7. **Filtering Conditions**: Use TRUE/FALSE for boolean values.\n",
    "    8. **Use Explicit Joins**: Avoid implicit joins.\n",
    "    9. **Optimize for Performance**: Use indexes, avoid unnecessary calculations, and limit results when needed.\n",
    "    10. **Restrict Queries to Existing Tables**: Only use \"cases\" and \"activity\" tables.\n",
    "    11. **Use JOINS only when necessary**: Avoid unnecessary joins.\n",
    "    ### Output Format  \n",
    "    - Return only the SQL query, with no extra formatting.  \n",
    "    - Do **NOT** include language tags like `sql`, `vbnet`, or any other markers.  \n",

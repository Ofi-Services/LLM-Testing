    "      - avg_time (DOUBLE): Avg duration (sec) across cases in this variant\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Query Guidelines\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Always reference columns with aliases (e.g., c.id, a.case_id).\n",
    "    2. Use UNNEST() in the FROM clause to access list fields like v.activities or v.cases. Do not use UNNEST() inside expressions like = ANY(...).\n",
    "    3. When comparing list values (e.g., activity names), first UNNEST the list in a subquery or CTE, then use direct comparison with TRIM(...).\n",
    "    4. Use TRIM() when comparing activity names (e.g., TRIM(a.name) = TRIM(...)).\n",
    "    5. Avoid unnecessary joins or full scans when possible.\n",
    "    6. Convert time differences with EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...).\n",
    "    7. Include all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Variant Comparison Rules\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Most Frequent Path:**  \n",
    "      SELECT * FROM variants WHERE number_cases = (SELECT MAX(number_cases) FROM variants)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Variant Durations:**  \n",
    "      Use avg_time from variants. Do not recompute durations from activities unless explicitly requested.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Deviations:**  \n",
    "      Variants with id different from the most frequent one are deviations.  \n",
    "      To detect deviation points, compare activities with the most frequent variant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Activity Durations Along Most Frequent Path:**  \n",
    "      1. Extract activities using UNNEST(v.activities) AS activity.  \n",
    "      2. Join with activities table using TRIM(v_activity) = TRIM(a.name).  \n",
    "      3. Group by activity name and compute average tpt.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Common Pitfall Corrections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Never use UNNEST() inside = ANY(...). Use UNNEST in a FROM clause or CTE, then join or filter.\n",
    "    - Avoid > ALL(...). Prefer ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1 or = (SELECT MAX(...)).\n",
    "    - Use subqueries for filtered aggregations, like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      SELECT branch  \n",
    "      FROM cases  \n",
    "      WHERE approved = TRUE  \n",
    "      GROUP BY branch  \n",
    "      ORDER BY AVG(value) DESC  \n",
    "      LIMIT 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When aggregating on top branches, use subqueries or IN with preselected sets.\n",
    "    - If no data matches a filter, return NULL instead of error.\n",
    "    - To detect repeated activities on the same day:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      SELECT a.case_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', a.timestamp), COUNT(*)  \n",
    "      FROM activities AS a  \n",
    "      GROUP BY a.case_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', a.timestamp)  \n",
    "      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "      (Avoid GENERATE_SERIES here.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Error Examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Incorrect:*\n",

    "        ### Query Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. **Prefer Direct Tables**:  \n",
    "        Use `grouped (g)` or `invoices (i)` directly unless item-level fields are explicitly needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **UNNEST Only When Necessary**:\n",
    "        - Only use `UNNEST(g.items) AS item` when accessing nested fields (e.g., `item.case.supplier`, `item.unit_price`, etc.)\n",
    "        - After unnesting, access fields as `item.field` or `item.case.supplier`, **not** `item.unnest.field`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Nesting and Access Rules**:\n",
    "        - To access supplier from `grouped`, unnest items and use:  \n",
    "            ```sql\n",
    "            FROM grouped g, UNNEST(g.items) AS item\n",
    "            WHERE item.case.supplier = 'Example'\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        - Avoid referencing nested fields without unnesting first.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. **Case Sensitivity**:\n",
    "        - Use exact case for values:\n",
    "            - Confidence: 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'\n",
    "            - Pattern: 'Similar Value', 'Similar Reference', 'Exact Match', 'Similar Date', 'Similar Vendor', 'Multiple'\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. **Use Table Aliases**:\n",
    "        - Always use `g.` for `grouped`, `i.` for `invoices`, and `item.` after unnesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. **Use TRIM() for Comparisons**:\n",
    "        - For text comparisons like pattern or supplier, wrap with `TRIM()`.  \n",
    "            Example: `TRIM(item.case.supplier) = 'VendorName'`\n",
    "\n",
    "        7. **Use IN / = ANY for Multiple Matches**:\n",
    "        - Use `pattern = ANY (['Value1', 'Value2'])` or `IN (...)` instead of OR chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "        8. **GROUP BY Nested Fields**:\n",
    "        - If grouping by nested fields like supplier, first unnest, then group by `item.case.supplier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        9. **Aggregation and Filtering**:\n",
    "        - Use `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1` instead of `> ALL(...)`\n",
    "        - Filter early with WHERE clauses to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        10. **Alternative Access**:\n",
    "        - Use `invoices` for simpler flat queries (e.g., `i.case_supplier`).\n",
    "\n",
    "        ---\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Output Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ❌ Do NOT explain the query.\n",
    "        - ✅ Only return the SQL query (no markdown, no comments, no formatting).\n",
    "        - ❌ Do NOT guess field names.\n",
    "        - ✅ Always respect the provided schema and capitalization.\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking, \"How many delayed invoices are there?\" I need to figure out the steps to answer this. Let me start by understanding what a delayed invoice means. Probably, it's an invoice that wasn't paid on time, maybe past its due date.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should check the available tools. There's Process Mining (SQL,0) and Invoice Analysis (SQL,1). Since the question is about invoices, maybe Invoice Analysis is the right tool here. But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user wants a count of delayed invoices. So I need to query the invoice data. But what's the structure of the data? I don't have that info. Maybe I need to first get the list of invoices and then check their status or due dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the tools available are SQL,0 and SQL,1. Maybe SQL,0 is for process mining, which could involve looking at the workflow or process steps, while SQL,1 is for invoice analysis, which might have the invoice details. So for counting delayed invoices, I should use SQL,1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to make sure. Let me outline the steps. First, retrieve all invoices from the database using Invoice Analysis (SQL,1). Then, filter those that are delayed. But how to determine if an invoice is delayed? Maybe there's a 'due_date' and 'payment_date' field. If payment_date is after due_date, it's delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without knowing the schema, I have to assume. So the first step would be to query all invoices. Then, in the next step, check which ones are delayed. But since the user wants the count, maybe I can do a SQL query that counts the invoices where payment_date > due_date.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might not have the payment_date. Maybe the status is marked as 'delayed'. Alternatively, maybe the process mining tool can track the process steps and see if the invoice was processed late. But the question is about invoices, so probably the Invoice Analysis tool is better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use Invoice Analysis (SQL,1) to get all invoices.\n",
      "2. Filter the invoices where the payment is overdue (based on due date and payment date).\n",
      "3. Count those filtered invoices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the system requires a numbered list of up to 10 tasks. Let me structure that. However, the user's answer format is a JSON with activities. Each activity has a type, description, reason, and steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the first activity would be using SQL,1 to retrieve invoice data. Then, maybe a THINK step to interpret the data and count the delays. But the steps in the activity need to be an array of integers. Wait, the steps in the activity are the steps that the activity itself takes. But the user's instruction says to generate a numbered list of tasks. Maybe each activity corresponds to a task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's instruction says: \"Generate a numbered list of up to 10 sequential tasks needed to fully answer the user's question.\" So each task is an activity. The output format is a JSON with activities, each with steps. But the steps in each activity are the steps that the activity takes. But the user's example shows that the steps are an array of integers, which probably refer to the previous activities.\n",

      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps in each activity are the indices of the previous activities. For example, ACTIVITY2's steps are [1], meaning it depends on ACTIVITY1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the user's question, the first task would be to retrieve the invoice data using Invoice Analysis (SQL,1). Then, the next task would be to analyze the data to find delays, which might require a THINK step. But how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use SQL,1 (Invoice Analysis) to get all invoices. This would involve a query to select all invoices, maybe with their due dates and payment dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Then, use a THINK step to determine which invoices are delayed. This would involve checking if the payment date is after the due date. But since the user wants the count, maybe the THINK step would process the data from the first activity and count the delayed ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the steps in the THINK activity would reference the previous activity (1). So the steps array would be [1].\n",
      "\n",
      "So the JSON would have two activities: ACTIVITY1 (SQL,1) and ACTIVITY2 (THINK), with steps [1] for ACTIVITY2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's question is straightforward. Maybe there's more steps. For example, if the data isn't directly available, maybe need to join tables or check other data. But without knowing the schema, it's hard to say. So the minimal steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "ACTIVITY1: Use Invoice Analysis to get invoices.\n",
      "\n",
      "ACTIVITY2: Think to count delayed ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe the user expects more steps. Let me think again. What if the data isn't in a single table? Maybe need to join with another table. But the user hasn't provided schema info. So the answer should be as per the available tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the process mining tool (SQL,0) is needed to check the process steps and see if the invoice was delayed in the process. But the question is about invoices being delayed, not the process steps. So probably Invoice Analysis is the right tool.\n",
      "\n",

Typically, this would involve checking the invoice\\'s due date against the actual payment date. If the payment was made after the due date, it\\'s considered delayed.\\n\\nBut wait, the user hasn\\'t provided specific data or context about the invoices. Are there any particular parameters they want me to consider? Like, maybe the company\\'s payment terms, or a specific time frame for what\\'s considered a delay? Without that, I might need to make some assumptions.\\n\\nAlso, do they have a list of invoices with dates, or is this a hypothetical scenario? If there\\'s no data, I can outline the steps one would take to identify delayed invoices. For example, checking each invoice\\'s due date, comparing it to the payment date, and flagging those where the payment was late.\\n\\nAnother thought: Are there any exceptions or special cases? Like invoices that were paid on time but had delays in processing, or maybe partial payments? The user might need to clarify if they want to account for those scenarios.\\n\\nSince the original context was incomplete, I should ask for the necessary details. But since the user provided a task now, maybe they expect a general approach. I should structure the response to explain the process, mention the required data points, and ask for specifics if needed. That way, it\\'s helpful whether they have data or not.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo analyze invoices for delays, follow these steps:  \\n1. **Define \"delayed\"**: Confirm criteria (e.g., payment after due date, beyond agreed terms).  \\n2. **Data required**: Invoice due dates, payment dates, and status (e.g., paid, pending).  \\n3. **Comparison**: Flag invoices where payment date > due date.  \\n4. **Prioritization**: Highlight critical delays (e.g., late by 30+ days, high-value invoices).  \\n\\nPlease provide invoice data or specific rules for analysis.']"

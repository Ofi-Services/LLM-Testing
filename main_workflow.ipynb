    "      - avg_time (DOUBLE): Avg duration (sec) across cases in this variant\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Query Guidelines\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Always reference columns with aliases (e.g., c.id, a.case_id).\n",
    "    2. Use UNNEST() in the FROM clause to access list fields like v.activities or v.cases. Do not use UNNEST() inside expressions like = ANY(...).\n",
    "    3. When comparing list values (e.g., activity names), first UNNEST the list in a subquery or CTE, then use direct comparison with TRIM(...).\n",
    "    4. Use TRIM() when comparing activity names (e.g., TRIM(a.name) = TRIM(...)).\n",
    "    5. Avoid unnecessary joins or full scans when possible.\n",
    "    6. Convert time differences with EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...).\n",
    "    7. Include all non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Variant Comparison Rules\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Most Frequent Path:**  \n",
    "      SELECT * FROM variants WHERE number_cases = (SELECT MAX(number_cases) FROM variants)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Variant Durations:**  \n",
    "      Use avg_time from variants. Do not recompute durations from activities unless explicitly requested.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Deviations:**  \n",
    "      Variants with id different from the most frequent one are deviations.  \n",
    "      To detect deviation points, compare activities with the most frequent variant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Activity Durations Along Most Frequent Path:**  \n",
    "      1. Extract activities using UNNEST(v.activities) AS activity.  \n",
    "      2. Join with activities table using TRIM(v_activity) = TRIM(a.name).  \n",
    "      3. Group by activity name and compute average tpt.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Common Pitfall Corrections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Never use UNNEST() inside = ANY(...). Use UNNEST in a FROM clause or CTE, then join or filter.\n",
    "    - Avoid > ALL(...). Prefer ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1 or = (SELECT MAX(...)).\n",
    "    - Use subqueries for filtered aggregations, like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      SELECT branch  \n",
    "      FROM cases  \n",
    "      WHERE approved = TRUE  \n",
    "      GROUP BY branch  \n",
    "      ORDER BY AVG(value) DESC  \n",
    "      LIMIT 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When aggregating on top branches, use subqueries or IN with preselected sets.\n",
    "    - If no data matches a filter, return NULL instead of error.\n",
    "    - To detect repeated activities on the same day:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      SELECT a.case_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', a.timestamp), COUNT(*)  \n",
    "      FROM activities AS a  \n",
    "      GROUP BY a.case_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', a.timestamp)  \n",
    "      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "      (Avoid GENERATE_SERIES here.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Error Examples\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Incorrect:*\n",

    "        - After unnesting, access fields as `item.field` or `item.case.supplier`, **not** `item.unnest.field`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Nesting and Access Rules**:\n",
    "        - To access supplier from `grouped`, unnest items and use:  \n",
    "            ```sql\n",
    "            FROM grouped g, UNNEST(g.items) AS item\n",
    "            WHERE item.case.supplier = 'Example'\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        - Avoid referencing nested fields without unnesting first.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. **Case Sensitivity**:\n",
    "        - Use exact case for values:\n",
    "            - Confidence: 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'\n",
    "            - Pattern: 'Similar Value', 'Similar Reference', 'Exact Match', 'Similar Date', 'Similar Vendor', 'Multiple'\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. **Use Table Aliases**:\n",
    "        - Always use `g.` for `grouped`, `i.` for `invoices`, and `item.` after unnesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. **Use TRIM() for Comparisons**:\n",
    "        - For text comparisons like pattern or supplier, wrap with `TRIM()`.  \n",
    "            Example: `TRIM(item.case.supplier) = 'VendorName'`\n",
    "\n",
    "        7. **Use IN / = ANY for Multiple Matches**:\n",
    "        - Use `pattern = ANY (['Value1', 'Value2'])` or `IN (...)` instead of OR chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "        8. **GROUP BY Nested Fields**:\n",
    "        - If grouping by nested fields like supplier, first unnest, then group by `item.case.supplier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        9. **Aggregation and Filtering**:\n",
    "        - Use `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1` instead of `> ALL(...)`\n",
    "        - Filter early with WHERE clauses to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        10. **Alternative Access**:\n",
    "        - Use `invoices` for simpler flat queries (e.g., `i.case_supplier`).\n",

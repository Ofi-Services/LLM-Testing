    "    - name (VARCHAR): Activity name  \n",
    "    - case_index (BIGINT): Alias of id  \n",
    "    - tpt (DOUBLE): Duration of the activity in seconds  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **variants (v)**  \n",
    "    - id (BIGINT): Variant ID (PK for path)  \n",
    "    - activities (LIST<TEXT>): Ordered activity names for this path  \n",
    "    - cases (LIST<VARCHAR>): IDs of cases that followed this path (→ cases.id)  \n",
    "    - number_cases (BIGINT): Total cases following this variant  \n",
    "    - percentage (DOUBLE): percentage of total cases  \n",
    "    - avg_time (DOUBLE): Avg duration (sec) across cases in this variant  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Query Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Use table aliases: cases → c, activity → a, variants → v  \n",
    "    2. Always reference columns with aliases (e.g., c.id, a.case)  \n",
    "    3. Use `UNNEST()` for accessing list fields like v.activities or v.cases  \n",
    "    4. Use `= ANY(...)` when filtering against list fields  \n",
    "    5. Use `TRIM()` for comparing activity names (e.g., TRIM(a.name))  \n",
    "    6. Avoid unnecessary joins or full scans when possible  \n",
    "    7. Convert time differences with `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ...)`  \n",
    "    8. Include all non-aggregated columns in `GROUP BY`  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Variant Comparison Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Most Frequent Path**:  \n",
    "    Get the variant with the max number_cases:  \n",
    "    `SELECT * FROM variants WHERE number_cases = (SELECT MAX(number_cases) FROM variants)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    -**Variant Durations**:\n",
    "    - Use avg_time from variants when querying variant-level durations. Avoid recomputing durations using activity.timestamp unless explicitly asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Deviations**:  \n",
    "    All variants with a different ID from the most frequent one are deviations.  \n",
    "    Use `UNNEST(activities)` and compare step-by-step if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Activity Durations Along Most Frequent Path**:  \n",
    "    1. Extract activities of the most frequent variant  \n",
    "    2. Join with activity table to calculate avg tpt per activity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Common Pitfall Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Avoid using `> ALL(...)` for comparisons across groups. Instead, use `ORDER BY ... LIMIT 1` or `= (SELECT MAX(...))` for selecting top values.\n",
    "    - When filtering branches or groups with the highest average, use subqueries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        SELECT branch\n",
    "        FROM cases\n",
    "        WHERE approved = TRUE\n",
    "        GROUP BY branch\n",
    "        ORDER BY AVG(value) DESC\n",
    "        LIMIT 1\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When calculating sums/averages for filtered groups (like top branches), prefer joins or IN subqueries from pre-identified groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If no data matches a filter, return NULL. Do not create over-restrictive filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When filtering by repeated activities on the same day, use GROUP BY a.case, DATE_TRUNC('day', a.timestamp) and HAVING COUNT(*) > 1. Avoid joining with GENERATE_SERIES.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Return **only** the SQL query. No markdown, no tags, no explanation.\n",
    "    - Never guess values. Always infer based on the data and schema above.\n",

This might be due to limitations in our current data processing capabilities or dataset structure.\\n\\n**Business Insights:**\\n\\n- Without detailed information on deviation points and their durations, it's challenging to provide precise insights into how deviations impact process times.\\n- However, we can infer that cases following the most common path take approximately 4.3 hours on average to complete.\\n- To improve our understanding of deviations' impacts, we recommend:\\n  - Investing in better data collection or processing methods to accurately identify deviation points and their durations.\\n  - Conducting further analysis once these improvements are implemented to understand how deviations affect process times and overall efficiency.\\n\\n**Next Steps:**\\n\\n- Address the SQL query errors by refining our queries or improving our dataset structure.\\n- Collect more detailed data on deviation points and their durations for better insights into process inefficiencies.\",\n",

    "           For every subquestion, use the `execute_sql_with_prompt` tool. Pass both the subquestion and the prompt exactly as received.\n",
    "           - Wait for each tool call to complete.\n",

    "           Once all necessary subquestions have been answered and sufficient information is collected:\n",
    "           - Use the results to formulate a complete and correct answer to the original user question.\n",

    "        \n",
    "        ## Restrictions\n",
    "        - DO NOT generate SQL yourself.\n",
    "        - DO NOT return partial answers or summaries before all relevant subquestions have been resolved.\n",
